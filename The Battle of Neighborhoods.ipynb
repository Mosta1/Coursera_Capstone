            "source": "# First Part, The Report:\n\n# 1 - Introduction: The problem I chose is that if a person wanted to open a restaurant in New York City, which place would be most ideal for him and\n# his business.\n# Obviously this problem targets business owners in NYC who would like to know what factors determine which place would be suitable for their business\n# to thrive.\n\n# 2 - Data: The data I will be using is the Foursquare location data.\n# I will be using this data to view and determine which area in NYC is best for the restaurant, by looking at different factors which include:\n# The shops and restaurants that are open near the area, the location of the area and whether its visited by many people or not,\n# the rating of nearby shops and their popularity, whether the restaurant would be a unique addition to the area or not.\n\n# 3 - Methodology: I first imported the data of NYC and loaded it, then I chose to focus on manhattan as it's the most populated area of NYC,\n# and for the restaurant to thrive, we would need a lot of people to come to the area.\n\n# 4 - Results: After that, I checked the neighborhood and nearby venues and chose the place I found most suitable for the restaurant,\n# the place had a diverse set of venues, only 1 pizza place, and other interesting venues someone would like to visit before or after\n# eating in the restaurant.\n\n# 5 - Discussion: I would recommend that u study the areas that relate to your problem well, and make sure that the variables which affect your \n# problem are there.\n\n# 6 - Conclusion: The best areas for a restaurant to open is the areas which don't have many competing restaurants, but have a diverse set of venues,\n# as well as being in a popular area which is visited often by a large amount of people."
